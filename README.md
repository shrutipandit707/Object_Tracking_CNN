## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

In this notebook will be tracking objects in videos using CNN.


- What is the background of your project?

In this notebook will be tracking objects in videos using CNN.

- Business Problem Statement:

In previous notebooks, we have seen the following pipeline:
1. Taking the difference between 2 images
2. Applying a blur
3. Thresholding of an image
4. Morphological transformations

At the end of this pipeline, you are left with the 'contours' of the moving objects that you are trying to identify.


- What is the dataset that is being used?

We have got the dataset from Upgrad.

## Conclusions
- We used CNN for tracking objects in a video.
